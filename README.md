### Purpose
This is for class data engineering mini project 8. It rewrites a Python Script in Rust. It takes an existing Python script for data processing, rewrites it in Rust, and highlights improvements in speed and resource usage.

### Requirements
  * Take an existing Python script for data processing
  * Rewrite it in Rust
  * Highlight improvements in speed and resource usage

### Functionality
The code (both in Python and Rust) does: ETL-Query: [E] Extract a dataset from URL, [T] Transform, [L] Load into SQLite Database and [Q] Query For the ETL-Query lab:
  * [E] Extract a dataset from a URL with CSV format.
  * [T] Transform the data by cleaning, filtering, enriching, etc to get it ready for analysis.
  * [L] Load the transformed data into a SQLite database table using Python's sqlite3 module.
  * [Q] Accept and execute general SQL queries on the SQLite database to analyze and retrieve insights from the data.

### Steps
I cloned the project template created by Professor Noah Gift and modified the template. Based on the template from professor, I made the following changes:
1. Cargo init to add rust constructions
2. Update makefile
3. Create yml file separately for python and rust
4. Modify python functions libraries based on mini project 5
5. Create and modify cargo files to match with the functions in python
6. Add log function that will keep track of the time and computer memoery uesed

### Rust Implementation
It measures and logs the elapsed time for the extraction operation specifically and appends this information to a Markdown file named `rust_query_log.md`.

##### Preparation and Dependency Installation:
1. open codespaces 
2. wait for codespaces to be built 
3. build: `cargo build` for dependencies installation
4. run: `cargo run`

##### Check Format and Test Erros: 
1. Format code `make format`
2. Lint code `make lint`
3. Test coce `make test`

### Python Implementation
It measures and logs the elapsed time for the extraction operation specifically and appends this information to a Markdown file named `python_query_log.md`.

##### Preparation and Dependency Installation:
1. open codespaces 
2. wait for codespaces to be built
3. install: `make python_install`

##### Check Format and Test Errors: 
1. Format code `make python_format`
2. Lint code `make python_lint`
3. Test coce `make python_test`

### Comparison
The python time and memory usage file is [here](https://github.com/nogibjj/Fall2023_IDS706_MiniProject8_JiayiZhou/blob/main/python_query_log.md) and the Rust time and memory usage file is [here](https://github.com/nogibjj/Fall2023_IDS706_MiniProject8_JiayiZhou/blob/main/rust_query_log.md). Also, as we can see from the screenshots below, python take more memory and more time to process the same function. As mentioned in class, the time improvement may because Rust is a compiled language, which means the code is translated into machine code before execution. Python, on the other hand, is an interpreted language, and code is executed line by line. This compilation step in Rust allows for optimizations that can make it more efficient in terms of both time and memory. The memory improvement may because Rust is a statically typed language, which means variable types are known at compile-time. Python, however, is dynamically typed, and type information is checked at runtime. This can result in more efficient memory usage.
